            <br/>
                <p><font size="4px"> I am currently a postdoc in the Basic & Applied Molecular Foundations Group at the <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>, working under the direction of <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=5608" target="_blank">Dr. Vanda Glezakou</a> and <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=6009" target="_blank">Dr. Roger Rousseau</a>. My research focuses on the computational study of gas (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>) separations and catalysis.</font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics (emphasis in Physics) from UC Riverside in 2015. I then joined UC Riverside's Materials Science & Engineering graduate program in the <a href="http://www.bmwong-group.com/" target="_blank">Nanoscale & Mesoscale Energy Materials Research Group</a>. After completing my M.S., I joined Peter A. Greaney's <a href="http://alexgreaney.com/" target="_blank">Computational Materials Group</a> to finish my PhD. The focus of my dissertation was the atomistic modeling of amorphous materials, particularly amorphous metal oxides and water-in-salt electrolytes. </font></p>
            <p><font size="4px"> In my research, I combine atomistic modeling, both at the electronic (quantum) and atomic (classical) level, with machine learning methods. I am excited and passionate about developing new ways to solve novel problems in materials science and chemistry <i>in silico</i> in order to help accelerate scientific discovery.</font></p>
