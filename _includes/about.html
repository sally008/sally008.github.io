                <p><font size="4px"> I am currently a postdoc in the <a href="http://alexgreaney.com/" target="_blank">Computational Materials Group</a> at the University of California Riverside. My research focuses on atomistic modeling of amorphous materials. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics (emphasis in Physics) from UC Riverside in 2015. I then joined UC Riverside's Materials Science & Engineering graduate program in the <a href="http://www.bmwong-group.com/" target="_blank">Nanoscale & Mesoscale Energy Materials Research Group</a>. After completing my M.S., I joined Peter A. Greaney's <a href="http://alexgreaney.com/" target="_blank">Computational Materials Group</a> to finish my Ph.D. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> The question I am presently most interested in is, how can we accurately and efficiently model amorphous (i.e., non-crystalline) materials? To answer this question, I combine conventional ab initio and classical molecular dynamics with machine learning and other configurational search methods to study a variety of materials, including amorphous oxides, multi-component alloys, and water-in-salt electrolytes.</font></p>
